The data file i will be using contains 26 columns, and 722 rows of data.
the data is in csv format such that i can have pandas read the data. 

There are empty fields. And there are also columns that are of no use to me
using pandas i will fill value or get rid of fields with no data.
I will also get rid of the columns that provide no use.

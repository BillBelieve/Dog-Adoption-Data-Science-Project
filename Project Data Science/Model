The required steps are basically the same as in the test model

required steps:
1) choose model - multiple regression.
2) select model hyperparameters
3) arrange data in feature matrix
4) fit model to data
5) apply model to inference and prediction problems.

only the data on which we apply the model is different.

now we use the test data instead of the train data

when we have the model ready, we need to evaluate it.

To evaluate the model we will use
R2
R2 adj
MSE mean squared error.

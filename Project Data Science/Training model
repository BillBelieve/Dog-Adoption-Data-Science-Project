The model will be calculated with help of scikit-learn

required steps:
1) choose model - multiple regression.
2) select model hyperparameters
3) arrange data in feature matrix
4) fit model to data
5) apply model to inference and prediction problems.

from step 3 i will have 2 datasets,
train data and test data.

the train data is a subset of the actual data set.
i will use roughly 30% of the test data to train the model.
leaving 70% of the data to test.

When the training model is finished, i will evaluate it.

to evaluate the training we will use:

mean squared error
R2
R2 adj

these parameters can be calculated using the sklearn module.

The model will be calculated with help of scikit-learn

required steps:
1) choose model - multiple regression.
2) select model hyperparameters
3) arrange data in feature matrix
4) fit model to data
5) apply model to inference and prediction problems.

steps 1-4 will be used on a training set which is a subset of
 the original dataset.

 this data will be excluded from the prediction data.
 step 5 will be done with the prediction data in the actual model.
